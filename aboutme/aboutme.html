    <h2>FRANCO ERMACORA</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Franco Ermacora, I from Argentina.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I am studying applied technology, 
        this helps me to achieve my goals,
        and projects and also to improve my
        job opportunities. I hope to be a
        web developer who can add to society.
        I married my wife a month ago, she is
        studying programming as well. I love drawing,
        it's my passion. I want to mix programming and art.

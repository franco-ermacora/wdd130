      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the page is to upload additional content, both art
         and code, so people can see my projects and ideas, as if it were a resume.
         Also have a little more closeness to the people who 
         consult me. And later also sell personal merchandising.

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The main idea is that people entering my website can see two
        things since I am going to focus on two audiences, people
        interested in art and people interested in programming. 
        The main page is very simple, with two squares with two 
        options, one option takes people to my catalog of drawings
        that I will upload weekly, and the other option is programming,
        people can see my progress or code projects. <br>
        <br>Also in 
        the footer, my social networks with a direct link to 
        my profile, an email, and the Linkedin link. <br>
        <br>I want my web page to be able to visit the maximum number 
        of people possible, that will be thanks to the effort I make on 
        social networks as well. I want artists, programmers and
         also companies to see my talent and my passion.
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      <img src="images/Logo_back.png" alt="image background" width="300px">

      </ul>
      <h3>Drawing</h3>
      <p>
        Page two, which would be the page where I would upload my drawings, 
        would be an extensive catalog, next to each image the name of the 
        work of art, the date, the type of art, and if it is digital or
        hand-painted. Under each illustration I am going to put a box where 
        people can ask about the image, the message will arrive in my email,
        with the question and what image it is from, the idea is that I
        can interact with people a little closer.
        Under each image, people can rate with stars and also donate money.
        Also on page two, below everything, there will be an option for 
        commissions (Drawings that people ask me to make for them). I will
        also make a small section of tips and tools that I use for my
        drawings, very similar to what I will do on Instagram and my social networks.<br>
        <br>The main idea of page two is that people see my drawings and enjoy
        the art as I do, also the other objective, is that companies
        looking for programmers, see my site.

      </ul>
      <h3>Programing</h3>
      <p>
        The function of page three is to upload my personal projects or programming
        tasks, it is like a portfolio, divided into folders with the name
        of the project with simple images. Inside each folder people will
        have the option to download it and also a comment box that people
        can write and everyone will see a feedback.
